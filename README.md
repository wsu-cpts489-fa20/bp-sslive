# Al_week1 
# what is implemented
- A rough draft of the divisions and rounds. ( textboxs, buttons, dropdown selest box, tables) none of the progress have been conected to the back end mostly html rendering. 
- simple unit tests were added 

# what is missed
- functionality of the buttons and backend 

# reasons for missing 
- underestmating load and miss managment of time (individual and as a team). 
- as a team we were able to meet and discuss what needs to be done and always have an agend for a meeting but sometimes more than necceasry time is taken to reach a conclusion. 


The app can be launched to http://localhost:8081 through the command
